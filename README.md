# GasSteadySim.jl 

This package implements algorithms that are used to solve the steady state gas flow problem for a pipeline network with ideal and non-ideal equations of state.
``GasSteadySim.jl`` is not a registered Julia package. Hence installation of the package should be done as follows:

```julia 
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/kaarthiksundar/GasSteadySim.jl.git")
```

For the API usage, users are referred to the ``test/`` and the ``examples/`` directories.
